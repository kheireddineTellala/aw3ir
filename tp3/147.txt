ospf network types :

1 .  broadcast network : dr bdr 
elect the dr bdr default hello interfavlz  10 sec dead times  *4 
multicast is used to discover neighbors 
neighbors are discovred  

2 . ponit to point (ppp. hdlc) one adjacency no election for the dr and bdr 

default hello interval  10  dead *4   

3 . NBMA non broadcast (staticly configure the neighbors )  force the dr set ospf priority 
 default hello interval  30 secenod   120 sec dead 

4.  point to multipoint (each connection have seprate subnet) pvc  no need for dr ans bdr 

-----------------------------------------------


multicast  ip used for ospf : 224.0.0.5 all ospf routers 
                              224.0.0.6  communication with dr and bdr 

the hello protocel is used to elect the dr and bdr 
ospf priority  0 - 255 
ospf priority 0 it will not participate in the election 
the default priority  is   1   (ip ospf priority  xx  )
the highest router id is become the dr  (router id ) no preemption in ospf 
the dr is elected fist then the bdr 



the two routers shold agree in hello interval 



for every ipv6 address   that we add to interface a corespanding mulicast   
FF02::1:ff      to learn MAC adress to a corespanding to ipv6 adress 

------------
extended unique indentifier   use the mac for creating the ID-interface  in the ipv6 Addresse 

MAC-EUI
